after running the following script to get the marked duplicates, 
 MarkDuplicates I=./alignment/dgln31/accepted_hits.bam O=./alignment/dgln31/marked_duplicates_dgln31.bam M=./alignment/dgln31/marked_dup_metrics.txt
samtools view *dgln31.bam | grep "1024" | less -S

this gives 12700, very very small!
samtools view -f 1024 *dgln31.bam | less -S

the latter seems like a more reasonable one!
Here we get the output 3779981
