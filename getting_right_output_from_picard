after running the following script to get the marked duplicates, 
 MarkDuplicates I=./alignment/dgln31/accepted_hits.bam O=./alignment/dgln31/marked_duplicates_dgln31.bam M=./alignment/dgln31/marked_dup_metrics.txt
samtools view *dgln31.bam | grep "1024" | less -S

this gives 12700, very very small!
samtools view -f 1024 *dgln31.bam | less -S

the latter seems like a more reasonable one!
Here we get the output 3779981

when the correct output file has been created from MarkDuplicates, (note we maybe should do some sorting and stuff before and edit a flag corresponding to remove_dubplicates)

I ran this command to quantify abundance of all genes in the reference genome!
 "cufflinks -g ../../S288C_reference_genome_R64-1-1_20110203/saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-1-1_20110208.gff marked_duplicates_dgln31.bam -o test_cufflinks"

note that the output name test_cufflinks is not particularily clever, and also note that it is stored in the same directory as the marked duplicates but in a one step deeper folder!

" reading on the internet, it might be suitable to run the following flag in the program to exclude all reads mapping to rRNA, tRNA and such stuff
"-M/mask-file <mask.(gtf/gff)>" ,  where the file thould be a reference to all tRNA and such!
