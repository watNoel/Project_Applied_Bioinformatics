# Project_Applied_Bioinformatics
Project in Applied Bioinformatics with aim to reproduce results from published bioinformatics-related project. 

The Report is named __Report_LC_ER_NW_ApplBio__

The paper we try to reproduce results from is found here 
[Critical Roles of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and GLN3 in Isobutanol-Specific Tolerance in Yeast](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471219303825?via%3Dihub&fbclid=IwAR1sm8l5mnIriLjvae50UiWEqT2HdD3D9pYmtvQRUG6fuDvvpTQSIThzSMg#mmc3).   
The raw data for the project is found via this page [E-MTAB-8175]( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-8175/samples/?keywords=&organism=Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae&exptype[0]=%22rna%20assay%22&exptype[1]=%22sequencing%20assay%22&array=&fbclid=IwAR13kITeyTE21skEvLn14Ea_2iA1JJ6P9Gj2ZnwSMp_32uhFCM3rmm2ZyA8).

The raw data for the referene genome we ended up using is found here [GTF-file](http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/gtf/saccharomyces_cerevisiae/), and [fasta file](http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-67/fasta/saccharomyces_cerevisiae/)

We produced a lot of processed data, and some of it is stored in the directory where it was used in this repository.
