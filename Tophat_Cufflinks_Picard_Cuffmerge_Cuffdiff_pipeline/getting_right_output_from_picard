after running the following script to get the marked duplicates, 
 MarkDuplicates I=./alignment/dgln31/accepted_hits.bam O=./alignment/dgln31/marked_duplicates_dgln31.bam M=./alignment/dgln31/marked_dup_metrics.txt
samtools view *dgln31.bam | grep "1024" | less -S

this gives 12700, very very small!
samtools view -f 1024 *dgln31.bam | less -S


the latter seems like a more reasonable one!
Here we get the output 3779981

when the correct output file has been created from MarkDuplicates, (note we maybe should do some sorting and stuff before and edit a flag corresponding to remove_dubplicates)

I ran this command to quantify abundance of all genes in the reference genome!
 "cufflinks -g ../../S288C_reference_genome_R64-1-1_20110203/saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-1-1_20110208.gff marked_duplicates_dgln31.bam -o test_cufflinks"

note that the output name test_cufflinks is not particularily clever, and also note that it is stored in the same directory as the marked duplicates but in a one step deeper folder!

" reading on the internet, it might be suitable to run the following flag in the program to exclude all reads mapping to rRNA, tRNA and such stuff
"-M/mask-file <mask.(gtf/gff)>" ,  where the file thould be a reference to all tRNA and such!

Recieved new sorted files from L to imprrve picardtools! 
copied these files to each relevant directory from her folder by the following command: different path for different samples of course, just switch dgln3_iso* to something else.
"  cp dgln3_isobutanol_2/marked_duplicates_removed.bam /home/student8/Project/data/alit/dgln3_isobutanol_2/sorted_marked_duplicates_removed.bam 

ran cufflinks using this new command in the folder in alihnmnet named after corresponding sample. e.g

"cufflinks -g <path-to-reference>.gff sorted_marked_duplicates.bam -o test_cufflinks" for the first sample

the next step after running for the first strain is to somehow merge the transcripts annotation using either cuffmerge or cuffcompare

the next step after running for the first strain is to somehow merge the transcripts annotation using either cuffmerge or cuffcompare!! also find some gtf file containing a ton of tRNA et cetera!

I ran cuffmerge to get a unified gff file for the gln3 strain! it threw a huge error saying "couldn't find fasta record for '2-micron'!" 
nevertheless, a merged.gtf file was produced which I presume is all that is gln3 strain! it threw a huge error saying "couldn't find fasta record for '2-micron'!" 
nevertheless, a merged.gtf file was produced which I presume is all that is needed!

the command i ran was:
" cuffmerge -o cuffmerge_out_gln3 -g ~/Project/data/S288C_reference_genome_R64-1-1_20110203/*.gff -s ~/Project/data/S288C_reference_genome_R64-1-1_20110203/S288C_reference_sequence_R64-1-1_20110203.fsa.fai assemblies.txt

note that this is in a new directory called "cuffmerge output". Also note the .fai extension to fsa file which i have no idea if it is different. the file was created when i ran cuffmerge and it crashed the fitst time
