# first cut out just the gene names, both from the list of all differentially expressed genes and the associated ones,
# taken from yeastgenome.org on the page related to GCN4..Then find all common names and store in some relevant file, 
#that can be directly used for deciding the shape in RenhancedVolcano in R. 

# this first command gets all gene names found from cuffdiffs differential expression of gene analysis output. note the path changes for different cuffdiff outputs.
cut -f 3 ../cds_exp_diff_wt | sed 1d | less -S | sort > all_found_genes_sorted
# this command trims the downloaded fils from yeastgenome.org which has all GCN4 targets known at the time with their annotation, which we discard.
cut -f 2 GCN4_targets.txt | tail -n +10 | sort > GCN4_targets_sorted
# this takes the common entries in the two produced files. 
comm -12 all_found_genes_sorted GCN4_targets_sorted > GCN4_targets_in_diff_exp_output 

#Why all this trouble of using comm -12 and cds_exp.diff? Well, we can not label things in cEnhancedVolcano that do not occur in the differential expression output.
